Storing small musical ideas and playing around with modularization using Guice.

Modules:
CORE        (what is the system about?)
Contains the core logic of models, and "business" (music) rules. Should depend on no other module.

INTERACTION (how should the user interact with the system?)
  |-> MIDI     (how should midi systems interact?)
  |-> TERMINAL (how should a terminal interact?)
Should depend only on CORE.

STORAGE     (how should the system store its data?)
Should depend only on CORE.
